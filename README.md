## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Vehicle length and ground clearnance are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model.

For vehicle length and ground clearance, the slope is considerably flat.  However, for vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD funcitonality, there is a positive correlation between those items and MPG.

This model predicts that certain elements affect MPG whereas other elements do not.  Thus, depending on the factor involved, MPG may or may not be affected.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
Per my findings, all three lots satisfy the manufacturing specifications for the suspension coils.  The variance is under tolerance.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
The P value for all individual lots was above our signifigance level, thus we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and the mean by lot is statistically similar to that of the whole.
